      An Architecture for Trustworthy Supply Chain Ledger Services
                draft-birkholz-scitt-architecture-latest

Abstract

   A transparent and authentic ledger service in support of a supply
   chain's integrity, transparency, and trust requires all peers that
   contribute to the ledgers operations to be trustworthy and authentic.
   In this document, the supply chain context is illustrated using
   problem statements, requirements are derived from use case
   definitions, and architectural constituents are specified and
   illustrated in usage scenarios.  The resulting architecture is
   intended to enable multi-layer interoperability to produce and
   leverage believable trust assertions while maintaining a minimal
   adoption threshold.

1.  Introduction

   The need for an understandable, scalable and resilient system that
   provides trustworthy transparency for various kinds of existing and
   emerging supply chains is a global one.  This memo specifies such a
   system called a Transparency Ledger (TL).  Transparency in the
   context supply chains always a well-scoped quality for each instance
   of a TL.  Transparency does not imply everybody, unconditionally.  A
   TL always limits the entities with the authority to include claims
   into the TL system.  On the other hand.  Analogously, a TL typically
   limits the entities to which transparency is granted.  Nevertheless,
   it is of great import to provide global interoperability for a
   multitude of instances as the composition and configuration of supply
   chains is ever changing and always in flux.

   A TL provides visibility into claims made by supply chain entities
   and their sub-system.  These claims Digital Supply Chain Artifacts
   (DSCA).  More importantly, a TL vouches for specific and well-defined
   metadata about these claims, including "when was the DSCA recorded by
   the TL", "who issued the DSCA to the TL", or "what type of DSCA are
   stored in the TL".  In fact, a DSCA can be opaque to the TL, if so
   desired.  The metadata that must be transparent and that has to
   warrant trust are about how DSCAs are handled by a component of the
   TL system, its inherent trustworthiness characteristics, and a record
   of the timeliness and accuracy of its operations.

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.
